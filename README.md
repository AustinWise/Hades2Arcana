# Hades 2 Arcana Solver

This program verifies Hades II arcana card setups and shows possible solutions to meet card
awakening requirements. While most cards only require grasp to active, some cards like "Divinity"
"The Queen" have more complex awakening requirements.

The user interface lets you mark which cards you are interested in. Each card has a checkbox that
can be in one of three states:

* blank - you don't card whether or not this card is used
* checked - you want this card to be used
* dashed - you DON'T want this card to be used

each time you check a card, the display is updated to display whether or not a possible solution
exists. Clicking "show solution" will show what combination of cards will satisfy your requirements.
